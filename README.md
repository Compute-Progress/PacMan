# PacMan

Project is mostly done. It is playable but there are some minor graphics issues (player and ghosts need to be offset
by a few pixels to match their actual locations)
Need to refactor some of the code but most of it fairly understandable.

--------NOT SURE ABOUT THESE YET------------

Unlikely that I add these but I will keep this there in case I ever want to finish this

- [ ] Scoreboard
- [ ] Diff maps
* 2 player mode
    - [ ] Co-Op
    - [ ] Vs
- [ ] AI PacMan?
